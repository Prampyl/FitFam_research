| Male     | 18.3%      | 36.9%      |
| Unknown  | 50.5%      | -          |

## 4. Category Analysis
FitFam's activity is heavily centered around high-intensity workouts, but there is significant diversity depending on location type.

### Top Categories

Top 3 Categories by Check-ins


| Category                  | Check-ins |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| HIIT                      | 211,971   |
| Wellness / Yoga / Pilates | 53,258    |
| Running                    | 51,520    |

### City vs. Virtual Preferences
- **Shanghai**: Strongly prefers **HIIT (141k)** and **Running (47k)**.
- **Virtual**: The top category is **Wellness / Yoga / Pilates (36k)**, followed by **HIIT (26k)**. This suggests the Virtual platform serves a different user need (flexibility, mindfulness) compared to physical locations.

## 5. Recommendations

### Strategic
- **Leverage the "Virtual" Success**: The Virtual community is the **2nd largest "city"**. Treat it as a distinct region with its own leaders and engagement strategy.
- **Formalize the Leadership Pipeline**: Proactively reach out to the **1,637 users** with 50+ check-ins. Offer them **"Assistant Leader"** roles to bridge the gap to full leadership.

### Operational
- **Data Quality**:
  - **Gender/Birthday**: Encourage users to update profiles for better personalization.
  - **Check-in Consistency**: Ensure all locations use the digital check-in system to capture the **40% "Unknown" gender data** (if correlated with manual tracking).

### Growth
- **Expand in Tier 2 Cities**: **Changzhou (24k check-ins)** shows FitFam can thrive outside tier-1 cities. Replicate the Changzhou model (likely strong local leadership) in cities like **Hangzhou** and **Suzhou**.
