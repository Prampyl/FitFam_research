# FitFam — Retention Project: Next Steps (Group Recap)

## Problematic (Primary Research Question)

**What are the key determinants of user retention in the FitFam community, and how can we strengthen long‑term participant loyalty across physical and virtual locations in China?**


## Five Sub‑Questions (One per Group Member)

1. **User Consistency:** How does early attendance frequency and consistency predict long-term retention?
2. **Leadership Quality:** How does the consistency and "quality" of leadership impact participant retention?
3. **Workout Type & Growth:** Which workout categories act as the strongest drivers for community growth and retention?
4. **Environmental Factors:** How do external conditions (temperature, pollution, seasonality) influence attendance and drop-off?
5. **Special Events:** Do "Special Events" (social runs, holiday events) successfully re-engage users and reduce churn?

---

## Hypotheses (Testable & Assignable)

> *Each group member take ownership of one hypothesis.*

* **H1 — Early Habit Formation:** Users who attend at least 3 sessions in their first 14 days (high consistency) are significantly more likely to remain active after 3 months than those who attend sporadically.
    * *[Feedback Fabien: "Consistency of those who participate (days, month)"]*
* **H2 — Leadership Impact:** Retention rates are higher for cohorts that attend sessions led by "High Quality" leaders (defined by high consistency, tenure, and rating proxies) compared to sporadic leaders.
    * *[Feedback Fabien: "Quality of leadership how to rate them"]*
* **H3 — Workout "Gateway" Effect:** Specific workout categories (e.g., Social Runs vs. Technical HIIT) yield higher long-term retention and are more effective at converting newcomers into regulars.
    * *[Feedback Fabien: "Qu'est ce qui font growth la participation (les workouts qui marchent le mieux pour la retention)"]*
* **H4 — Environmental Resilience:** Extreme environmental conditions (high temperature, pollution) serve as a loyalty filter: users who attend during these times show higher long-term retention, while casual users exhibit strong seasonal churn.
    * *[Feedback Fabien: "Grosses question (temperature elevee ou pas, pollution ou pas)... est ce que des gens ne s'entraine que l'été ou l'hiver"]*
* **H5 — Social Anchoring (Special Events):** Participation in "Special Events" (e.g., Halloween Run, Breakfast & Burpees) creates a social anchor, significantly reducing churn probability in the subsequent month compared to standard sessions.
    * *[Feedback Fabien: "Special events : exemple: halloween run... est ce que ces events créer de la retention"]*

# Next Steps (Steps 2 → 8)

> Each step includes **what we do**, **why we do it (research/reflection focus)**, and **success indicators**.

---

## Step 2 — Refine Objectives

* **Do:** Translate the problematic into 3–5 measurable research objectives (retention model, behavioral segmentation, leader impact testing).
* **Why (research):** Objectives ensure our analysis explores *mechanisms* behind retention, not just computes metrics. They anchor the project in theoretical reasoning.
* **Indicator:** Objectives explicitly linked to retention theory and our hypotheses.

---

## Step 3 — Additional Data Extraction & Feature Engineering

* **Do:** Create features such as early engagement metrics (0–14 days, 0–30 days), inactivity windows, leader consistency scores, category flags, cohort labels, virtual‑only indicators.
* **Why (research):** Features operationalize theoretical concepts—habit formation (early engagement), social identity (leader stability), digital engagement (virtual behavior). This connects data processing to scientific reasoning.
* **Indicator:** Feature table with variables clearly tied to hypotheses and theory.

---

## Step 4 — Exploratory + Inferential Analysis

* **Do:** Build retention curves, t‑tests/chi‑square tests for group differences, correlation matrix, plots by city/category/leader.
* **Why (research):** EDA becomes scientific when used to *challenge or support theoretical expectations*. This step identifies mechanisms worth modeling.
* **Indicator:** EDA where every figure includes a reflective interpretation and hypothesis link.

---

## Step 5 — Modeling (Regression + Clustering + Validation)

* **Do:** Run logistic regression or survival models for retention predictors; perform clustering for user typologies; validate with split tests.
* **Why (research):** Modeling tests causal‑like relationships and reveals hidden behavioral structures. This transforms the project from descriptive to explanatory science.
* **Indicator:** Interpreted coefficients and clusters explaining retention pathways (e.g., habit vs inconsistency vs leader‑driven loyalty).

---

## Step 6 — Build KPIs & Indexes

* **Do:** Compute retention KPIs, early‑engagement scores, leadership quality index, growth indicators.
* **Why (research):** KPIs summarize behavioral constructs and allow us to compare theoretical patterns across user groups or cities.
* **Indicator:** KPI tables interpreted in terms of behavioral theory, not operational metrics.

---

## Step 7 — Interpretation & Recommendations

* **Do:** Explain *why* users stay or leave based on evidence; link behaviors to theories; propose interventions aligned with mechanisms.
* **Why (research):** Interpretation is the core of academic inquiry—turning data into understanding. This is where we answer the problematic.
* **Indicator:** A coherent narrative of retention mechanisms + 5 theory‑supported recommendations.

---

## Step 8 — Reporting & Presentation

* **Do:** Write the full research report and prepare a slide deck summarizing reasoning, evidence, and insights.
* **Why (research):** The report demonstrates the logical chain connecting data → theory → analysis → interpretation → answers.
* **Indicator:** A structured report where each section supports the problematic and shows reflective thinking throughout.

## Optional Timeline (Quick)

* 1–3 days: Steps 2–3 (Objectives + features)
* 3–5 days: Steps 4–5 (EDA + modeling)
* 1–2 days: Steps 6–7 (KPIs + interpretation)
* 1–2 days: Step 8 (report + slides)

*End of recap — reflective version.*
