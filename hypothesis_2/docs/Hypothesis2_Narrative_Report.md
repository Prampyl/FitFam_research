# Research Narrative: The Role of Leader Consistency in User Retention

## 1. The Core Question

We set out to answer a fundamental question for FitFam: **Does the quality of a volunteer leader determine whether a new member stays or quits?**

Specifically, we wanted to know if a leader's **Consistency** (sticking to the same schedule every week) and **Tenure** (experience level) made a difference.

## 2. The Initial "Failure" (The First Leader Trap)

Our first approach was based on a common assumption: "First impressions matter most."
We identified the **First Leader** a user ever met and checked if that leader's habits influenced the user's long-term retention (staying > 3 months).

**The Result:** Determining the "First Leader" led to a dead end.

- The statistics showed **zero correlation**.
- It looked like it didn't matter if a leader was consistent or chaotic.

This result was puzzling and counter-intuitive. In a community built on human connection, surely the leader matters?

## 3. The Investigation (Why was the data wrong?)

We paused to critique our own method. We asked: _"Is the First Leader actually the most important relationship?"_

We analyzed the data to see how often users stuck with their first leader. The answer was: **Not often.**

- Only **43%** of a user's total visits were with their "First Leader".
- For half of the users, the "First Leader" was someone they saw once and never saw again, while they went on to become regulars with a completely different leader.

**The Flaw:** By attributing users to their "First Leader", we were often linking their success to a stranger they met once, rather than the leader who actually built their habit.

## 4. The Breakthrough (The Dominant Leader)

We changed our definition. Instead of the "First Leader", we identified the **"Dominant Leader"**—the person the user attended the most sessions with.

We re-ran the analysis with this new definition, and the picture changed completely.

**The New Result:**

- **Consistency is King.** There is a highly significant link (p < 0.0001) between a Dominant Leader's schedule consistency and user retention.
- **The "Reliability" Factor.** Users who found a "Dominant Leader" with a low schedule variance (meaning they always lead at the same time) were significantly less likely to quit.

## 5. The Statistical Mechanics (What actually mattered?)

It wasn't just about picking a winner. We used a **Multivariate Cox Regression** model to weigh different factors against each other simultaneously.

**What we measured (The Input):**

1.  **Consistency (The Star):** How standard was the gap between events? (e.g., exactly 7 days vs. random).
2.  **Frequency (The Volume):** How many times a month did they lead?
3.  **Tenure (Experience):** How long have they been a leader?
4.  **Control Variables:** We also controlled for Gender to ensure biological sex wasn't skewing the results.

**What the Model Found (The "Importance"):**

- **Consistency was the strongest predictor.** When a leader is erratic, the risk of a student quitting shoots up **significantly** (p < 0.0001).
- **Frequency mattered less.** Leading _more often_ is not as important as leading _predictably_.
- **Tenure didn't save them.** An experienced leader with a chaotic schedule is still worse for retention than a new leader with a stable schedule.

## 6. The Conclusion in Plain English

Leadership quality **does** drive retention, but it’s not about the "spark" of the first interaction. It’s about **reliability**.

Users stay when they find a leader who is a **habit-forming anchor**—someone who is there at the same time, every week, without fail. Inconsistent leaders, even if they are frequent or experienced, do not provide the stability needed for new members to form a lasting workout habit.

**Final Recommendation:**
Don't worry about ensuring the "best" leaders host the "first" sessions. Instead, focus on ensuring every leader commits to a rock-solid, predictable schedule. **Same time, same place, every week.** That is the secret to retention.
