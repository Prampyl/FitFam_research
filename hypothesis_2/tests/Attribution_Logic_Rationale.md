# Why "Dominant Leader" Attribution?

## 1. The "First Leader" Fallacy

Initially, we assumed the **First Leader** (the first person a user ever met) set the tone for their entire journey.
**The Problem:** Data showed this was often a random, one-off encounter.

- **Low Stickiness:** On average, users attended only **43%** of their sessions with their "First Leader".
- **Low Match Rate:** For **50%** of users, their "First Leader" was NOT the person they saw most often.

_Example:_ A user goes to one "hiit-mix" class with Leader A (who is inconsistent), then switches to "yoga" with Leader B (who is consistent) for the next 6 months. Attributing their retention to Leader A is statistically wrong.

## 2. The "Dominant Leader" Logic

We switched to the **Dominant Leader**—the specific individual with whom a user attended the **most events**.

**Why this is better:**

1.  **True Influence:** This is the person who actually built the user's habit.
2.  **Sample Size:** By definition, this captures the majority of the user's FitFam experience.
3.  **Statistical Signal:** When we switched to this metric, the **Consistency** signal jumped from _non-existent_ (p=0.54) to _highly significant_ (p < 0.0001).

**Conclusion:**
We characterize a user's experience by **who they saw most**, not **who they saw first**.
